# Fractals

Fractal creator application.

The fractal app has many settings that the user can tweak, including basic fractal settings such as image size, coordinate bounds, rotation, iterations, and ease of toggling between standard fractal iteration, where the coordinates in the complex plane are iterated (one instance of which includes the Mandelbrot set), and where arbitrary values are iterated (which can create Julia Sets). Notably, the user can alter the iterative equation in the main UI, and many atypical fractal landscapes can be viewed. 

Many coloring options are available, including a wide variety of settings that can be tweaked with the orbit traps.
